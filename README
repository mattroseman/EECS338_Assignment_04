To Run execute the sap file
the program starts processes at random intervals, of random amounts, and randomly chooses between withdraw and deposit
withdraw is choosen 2/3 of the time

the default is to start 10 processes but if you pass in a number argument "./sap 23" then 23 processes will start

I'v also included a text file SemaphoreAlgorithm.txt that has the algorithm in an easier to read manner

The Semaphore.c and SharedMemory.c files contail helper functions that call all the methods for creating,attaching, etc
semaphroes and shared memory
